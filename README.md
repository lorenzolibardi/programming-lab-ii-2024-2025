# Laboratorio II - Programming Lab (2024/2025)

This repository contains solutions to exercises in **C**, **Python**, and **Java**, completed as part of the *Laboratorio II* course at **Università di Pisa** during the academic year 2024/2025. The exercises cover fundamental programming concepts, including multi-threading, memory management, and advanced programming techniques.

## Repository Structure
- **`c/`** - Exercises and projects written in C.
- **`python/`** - Python scripts for various assignments.
- **`java/`** - Java-based exercises and object-oriented programming assignments.
- **`multithreading/`** - Multi-threaded programming examples and concurrency exercises.
- **`README.md`** - This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## Installing Required Tools

### C Compiler (GCC/Clang)

To compile and run **C** programs, install **GCC** (Linux/macOS) or MinGW (Windows):

```sh
# On Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install gcc  

# On macOS
brew install gcc  

# On Windows (using MinGW)
winget install -e --id=MinGW.MinGW
```

### Python
The exercises use Python 3.x. Install it via:

sh
```sh
# On Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install python3  

# On macOS
brew install python3  

# On Windows
winget install -e --id=Python.Python.3
```

### Java (JDK)
For Java exercises, install a JDK (e.g., OpenJDK):

```sh
# On Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk  

# On macOS
brew install openjdk  

# On Windows
winget install -e --id=Oracle.JDK.17
```

## Running the Code

### C Programs
Navigate to the **`c/`** directory and compile a C program using GCC:

```sh
gcc program.c -o program  
./program  
```

### Python Scripts
Run a Python script from the **`python/`** directory:

```sh
python3 script.py  
```

### Java Programs
Navigate to the **`java/`** directory and compile a Java file:

```sh
javac Program.java  
java Program  
```

## About the Course
Laboratorio II at **Università di Pisa** is a practical programming course covering:

- Low-level programming in C (pointers, memory management, data structures)
- High-level scripting in Python (data processing, automation)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java
- Multi-threading and concurrency techniques

This repository serves as a collection of solutions and notes to reinforce these concepts.
